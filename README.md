# Rock Paper Scissors Challenge (Static Version)

This version was made it **using only static files as html, css and js**, here you **cant found any library to transpile, minify, packaging, etc. your statics files or some framework to write easily JS**. Also used old CSS rules/properties combined with new ones (CSS3) to cover many **last version browsers (IE 11, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, iOS Safari, Opera, Chrome for Android, Samsung)** so you can display it in your mobile and have fun.

Because isn't a complex exercise was written with a basic and understandable architecture of **Javascript ES5**, so you can take a look and see how easy is read it and modify.
